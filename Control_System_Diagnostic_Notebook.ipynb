    "# Control System Diagnostic Notebook for Robotic Arm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "This notebook is designed to help identify and resolve response delays in the control code of a robotic arm. You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diagnose the root cause of delays in command response times.\n",
    "- Optimize control code for improved performance.\n",
    "- Document your findings and propose actionable solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "Follow the steps outlined in this notebook to diagnose and resolve issues in the robotic arm's control system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Libraries**: Run the provided setup code to load necessary Python libraries.\n",
    "2. **Run Diagnostic Functions**: Use the `check_response_time` function to measure command response times.\n",
    "3. **Analyze Findings**: Record observed delays and propose a hypothesis for their cause.\n",
    "4. **Test Optimizations**: Apply optimization logic and compare results.\n",
    "5. **Record Results**: Summarize your findings and recommendations in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on the `rotate_joint` command, as it has been flagged for delays.\n"
